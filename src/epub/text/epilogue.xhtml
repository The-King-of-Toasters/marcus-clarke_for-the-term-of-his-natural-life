			<p>At day-dawn the morning after the storm, the rays of the rising sun fell upon an object which floated on the surface of the water not far from where the schooner had foundered.</p>
			<p>This object was a portion of the mainmast head of the <i>Lady Franklin</i>, and entangled in the rigging were two corpsesâ€”a man and a woman. The arms of the man were clasped round the body of the woman, and her head lay on his breast.</p>
			<p>The Prison Island appeared but as a long low line on the distant horizon. The tempest was over. As the sun rose higher the air grew balmy, the ocean placid; and, golden in the rays of the new risen morning, the wreck and its burden drifted out to sea.</p>
